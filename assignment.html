        <h1>Pizza Recipe</h1>
        <p class="example2">Pizza is a dish that comes from Naples, Italy. It consists of a circular shaped dough with sauce, cheese, and other toppings of your choice. For this recipe, we will be making a simple Margherita Pizza.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Pizza dough (assumed to be made, <a href="#">recipe in case not</a>)</li>
            <li>Pizza sauce (assumed to be made, <a href="#">recipe in case not</a>)</li>
            <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>Freshly picked basil, garnsih</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Method</h2>

            <img id="floatRight" src="mozzarella_cheese.png" alt="Mozzarella cheese" width="200" height="200">
            Preheat your oven while you are assembling the pizza. Roll the dough into a circular shape, until it is big enough to fit on your pizza pan, or even a frying pan would be fine. Spread the sauce until most of the surface is covered in sauce (leave out the edges of the dough). If your cheese is shredded, sprinkle it over the sauce; if your cheese is still fresh, tear it apart and place it onto the sauce in places you think it will look good on. Place the pan with your pizza in the oven and bake for 10 minutes, turning every 4 minutes. Remove the pizza from the oven, top it off with fresh basil and ENJOY!
